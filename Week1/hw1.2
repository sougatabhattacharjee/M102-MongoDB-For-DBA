Download the file products.json from education.mongodb.com. Take a look at its content.

Now, import its contents into MongoDB, into a database called "pcat" and a collection called "products". Use the mongoimport utility to do this.

When done, run this query in the mongo shell:
db.products.find({type:"case"}).count()

>use pcat     //database will be created if it not exists!

from the terminal (not from the shell) type
$ mongoimport --db pcat --collection products < ~/mongodb_course/M102DBA/Week1/products.3eb7cd1a9633.json
//it will create products collection under database pcat and import the json data into the collection

now back to mongo shell, type
> db.products.find({type:"case"}).count()
